# Autopilot-TensorFlow
A TensorFlow implementation of this [Nvidia paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) with some changes. For a summary of the design process and FAQs, see [this medium article I wrote](https://medium.com/@sullyfchen/how-a-high-school-junior-made-a-self-driving-car-705fa9b6e860).

# IMPORTANT
Absolutely, under NO circumstance, should one ever pilot a car using computer vision software trained with this code (or any home made software for that matter). It is extremely dangerous to use your own self-driving software in a car, even if you think you know what you're doing, not to mention it is quite illegal in most places and any accidents will land you in huge lawsuits.

This code is purely for research and statistics, absolutley NOT for application or testing of any sort.

# How to Use
Download the [dataset](https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets) and extract into the repository folder

Use `python train.py` to train the model

Use `python run.py` to run the model on a live webcam feed

Use `python run_dataset.py` to run the model on the dataset

To visualize training using Tensorboard use `tensorboard --logdir=./logs`, then open http://0.0.0.0:6006/ into your web browser.
